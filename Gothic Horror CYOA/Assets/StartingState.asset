  storyText: "\r\n\tOh, my! It appears you caravan has careened of the mountain trail
    and into the \nforest below. Fortunately, your body is intact, save for some scratches
    on your face. \nUnfortunately, it seems the caravan driver has abandoned you.
    More unfortunately, \njudging by its position, the sun will set in three hours.
    \n\n\tDangerous things lurk in the woods even on the brightest, sunniest morrows.
    \nYou shan't imagine what might happen to you after dark.\r\n\r\n\t1. Examine
    the wrackage of the caravan.\r\n\t2. Proceed to the forest path ahead of you.
    \r\n"
