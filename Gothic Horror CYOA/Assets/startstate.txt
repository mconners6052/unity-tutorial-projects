	Oh, my! It appears you caravan has careened of the mountain trail and into the 
forest below. Fortunately, your body is intact, save for some scratches on your face. 
Unfortunately, it seems the caravan driver has abandoned you. More unfortunately, 
judging by its position, the sun will set in three hours. 

	Dangerous things lurk in the woods even on the brightest, sunniest morrows. 
You shan't imagine what might happen to you after dark.

1. Examine the wrackage of the caravan.
2. Proceed to the forest path ahead of you.
